/**
 * Lightweight thread implementation similar to goroutines.

 * Threads provide safe concurrent execution with compile-time Send/Sync validation.
 * All captured variables in the closure passed to spawn() must implement the Send trait.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```haxe
 * @:derive([Send])
 * class Message {
 *     public var data: String;
 *     public function new(data: String) { this.data = data; }
 * }
 *
 * var msg = new Message("Hello");
 * var handle = Thread.spawn(() -> {
 *     trace(msg.data); // OK: Message is Send
 *     return 42;
 * });
 *
 * var result = handle.join();
 * trace(result); // 42
 * ```
